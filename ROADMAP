Version 0.5:
	[ ] Player should have something to fight, and something that fights back
	[x] Player should be able to spawn target drones at will, but the enemies will be spawned automatically
	[ ] Shields, both cannons (fore and aft) and indicators for all of that should be implemented and working correctly.
	  - Optional: since screen real estate is a premium, we can turn off shield and cannon indicators when out of combat, and
	              allow the player to toggle the 'debug' display(s)
	[x] Code should be cleaned up significantly ready for some 1.0 features that I'm putting off

Version 1.0:
	- Native JS interpreter to be switched out for DSL
	- All 'stolen' assets should be replaced with first-party assets
	- Console style should be configurable by the player
	- A minimap should be available for hooking up to the 'screen' readout (bottom right, red border), including enemy location information
	- A short-range scanner should also be available, that presents a single enemy's information.  Some way of determining which enemy is 'targeted' should exist, so that the short-range scanner knows what to display.  It should display a grey X with a missing middle section if no enemies are in range or if there is any ambiguity about which enemy to display on the screen.
	- Server should track player position, client should update server and request updates from server only.  All the rest of the work can stay client-side at developer's discretion.

Future updates (with rough timing):
	1.0-2.0: Multiplayer
	0.5-1.5: Enemy bases
	2.0+: MMO-style "classes" of ship (support/medical, fighter, tank/mothership)
