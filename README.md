# Pilot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cjbrowne/Pilot.png?branch=multiplayer)](https://travis-ci.org/cjbrowne/Pilot)

A JavaScript game where you play a space pilot.  The interface is purely textual, and involves typing commands into a REPL.  Programming experience recommended, but not required.  Documentation available via "help [command]" and "guide" commands in-game.  There's a published version on Heroku at http://cjbrowne-pilot.herokuapp.com.
